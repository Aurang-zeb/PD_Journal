    <section id="intro">
      <h2>👋 1. Self-Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Aurangzeb, but most people call me Zeb. I have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Pakistan. During my studies, I worked on projects like an Automatic Bus Parking ⚙️ system using Arduino and C++. I also have experience with web development 💻 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and updating a many website with PHP and JavaScript.<br/><br/>
Outside academics, I enjoy exploring technology, learning about innovative teaching methods, and experimenting with small projects that combine programming and creativity. I also like reading articles on education, teaching strategies, and personal development.<br/><br/>
I am motivated to improve my teaching and learning skills because I want to guide students effectively and share knowledge in ways that are engaging and practical. I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and teaching is most effective when it encourages curiosity, creativity, and participation.

    </section>

    <section id="research">
      <h2>🗂️ 2. Reflective Methodology Research</h2>
      <p>I researched different reflective models, including Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle, Kolb’s Experiential Learning, and Brookfield’s Four Lenses. I chose Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle because it provides structured steps that help me make concrete action plans.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="experiences">
      <h2>3. Reflections on Experiences</h2>
      <h3>🎉 Welcome Days</h3>
      <p>During Welcome Days, I was introduced to my university, met classmates from various countries, and explored the campus 🏫. At first, I felt excited but also a little nervous because it was a new place for  me and I didn’t know anyone there.
I observed that small group discussions help everyone included and engage with each other. <br/><br/>This experience makes me realize that creating a welcoming environment is important for effective learning. When students feel comfortable and included the more likely to participate and learn from each other.<br/>
In my future teaching I will start lesson with a short activity such as 5 minutes team game 🎲 so students can introduce themselves and feel comfortable. I will observe how students interact in this activity and adjust them to encourage participation and collaborations 👥.
</p>
      <h3>🏠 ABC House Visit – Brussels</h3>
      <p>On my visit to ABC-House in Brussels, children and adults working with paper and wood to create small sculptures, a kitchen area where young learners experimented with cooking and designing, and an outdoor garden where participants were planting and discussing plant growth. 
I felt curious as soon as I walked in the place was friendly and full of activity. At first I was a little unsure how this relates to my own teaching background in computer science 💻 and web development. But I noticed how learners of all ages were working together, and learning by doing rather than listening. <br/>This made me realised about how collaboration and creative exploration are powerful.The ABC-House environment showed how “playful-making” and open-ended tasks help students take ownership of their learning, which is something I want to bring into my classroom.<br/>
In my future web development lessons, I will include one hands-on activity each week. For example, I will ask students to work in small groups to create a simple website about a topic they like. They can plan their ideas on paper or whiteboards ✏️before building it on the computer.
I will watch how students work together, see who asks for help from peers or from me, and at the end, ask them to share what they learned and what was difficult. This will help me understand how engaged they are 💡and how I can improve the activity for next time.
</p>
      <h3>🧪 Technopolis Visit – Mechelen</h3>
      <p>I visited Technopolis in Mechelen with my class. At the gate, there was a car that children could pull with ropes to learn about balance and force. Inside, I first saw an airplane simulator, which I also tried. It was exciting to learn how the controls worked. Then, I saw a space station area, where children were learning how astronauts live and work in space.
I also saw a robot 🤖with its “boss robot,” which was interesting for me as a computer 💻student because it showed how programming and robotics can work together. Later, I played a periodic table chemistry game🎮 with Hamza, and it helped me see how science can be made fun through games and technology. Before leaving, I even rode a bicycle on the roof, which was an amazing and unique experience.<br/>
I learned that students understand better when they can see and try things by themselves. It makes learning enjoyable and helps them remember it for a long time🧠.
In my future computer science or web development lessons, I will include hands-on and creative activities, just like in Technopolis. For example, students can build small interactive web projects or test real examples instead of only reading theory. This experience connects to John Dewey’s Experiential Learning theory, which says people learn by doing, and Piaget’s Constructivist approach, where learners build knowledge from their experiences.
</p>
      <h3>🏛️ MAS Museum Visit – Antwerp</h3>
      <p>I visited the MAS Museum in Antwerp with my class. The museum was a tall and beautifully designed building with different themes on each floor. I first entered the third floor, where I watched a video showing a dance class on the big screen it was interesting to see how movement and art were used to express culture and emotions.
As I moved to the next floors, I explored a section about World War II history, where I saw airplane models and artifacts. This part caught my attention because it connected technology, history, and innovation💡. Later, I visited another area that displayed different types of ships and art statues, showing how humans have developed creativity and skills across generations.<br/><br/>
This visit taught me that learning can happen through observation, visuals, and storytelling  not just from books. Museums can make history and culture come alive for students by engaging their curiosity and imagination🌍.<br/><br/>
In my future teaching, I will use visual learning tools like videos🎞️, virtual tours, or project-based storytelling to make topics more interactive. Just like in the MAS Museum 🏛️, I want students to explore🔍, observe, and connect what they see with what they learn in class.

    <section id="learning">
      <h2>🌱 4. PD & Lifelong Learning</h2>
      <p>I see reflection as a  🔁 continuous tool to improve myself 📈 and my teaching. Activities like Welcome Days, Museum Weekend, and ABC House show that learning is not just in lectures experiences outside class are just as valuable.
Writing this journal helps me track my growth, recognize what works well, and identify what I can improve. <br> Through this PD course, I am learning that professional development is not just a requirement it is a lifelong habit that helps me evolve as both a learner and a teacher. I believe this journal will be a valuable resource for my future teaching career.

    <section id="pedagogy">
      <h2>🌏 5. Inspiring International Pedagogy</h2>
      <p>I am impressed by Project-Based Learning , which comes from Constructivist theory (Piaget 🧠, Dewey). This approach encourages students to learn by doing, explore real-world problems 🌍, and think critically rather than just memorizing facts. I like this because it makes learning meaningful, motivates students to take ownership of their work, and allows them to discover solutions in a practical way. 
From my experience in computer science and web development 🖥️, I have seen that coding and creating projects is much more effective than just reading theory or watching tutorials on YouTube. For example, when I built my Automatic Bus Parking project with Arduino, I learned more from testing the hardware and solving problems than from only reading the instructions. Similarly, updating websites using PHP and JavaScript 💻helped me understand how code works in real-life situations.
In my future teaching, I will apply Project-Based Learning by giving students hands-on activities where they can build something meaningful. For example, I could ask students to create a small interactive website about a topic they like, such as a portfolio, games🎮, or community project. They will first plan their ideas on paper or whiteboards, then work in pairs or small groups 👥 to build the project on the computer. During the activity, I will observe how they collaborate, who asks peer questions, and how they solve challenges, just like I experienced while working on team coding projects. At the end of the session, students will reflect on what they learned and what they found challenging 💡. This approach will help students actively learn, practice problem-solving, and feel confident in applying concepts, just as I did during my practical computer science projects.

    <section id="philosophy">
      <h2>💻 6. My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Personally, I want to become a teacher 💻 who not only guides students but also helps them discover and develop their true potential 💎. I believe that students learn best through practical, hands-on experiences, not just theoretical lessons. While theory provides the foundation, applying concepts in real-life situations allows students to understand deeply🧠, retain knowledge, and build confidence in their abilities. For example, instead of only explaining a concept in class, I would include activities, experiments, or projects where students can practice and explore the idea themselves. <br>
I want my classroom to feel like a playground, where students can freely explore, experiment, and develop different skills while strengthening their learning. I believe that learning should be enjoyable and interactive, and that students should feel safe to ask questions, make mistakes, and learn from them. Curiosity, collaboration 👥, and creativity are central to my teaching philosophy. I aim to design lessons that encourage students to think critically, work together, and take ownership of their learning <br>Additionally, I see the role of a teacher as both a guide 🧭 and a mentor. Beyond academic knowledge, I want to support the social and emotional growth of my students, helping them build confidence, empathy, and resilience. My goal is to create an environment where students are motivated to learn, confident to explore new ideas💡, and inspired to reach their full potential both academically and personally.
</p>

    <section id="sel">
      <h2>💞 7. Social Emotional Learning (SEL)</h2>
      <p>I believe that social and emotional learning is just as important as learning theory. Understanding emotions helps students grow as confident and responsible individuals. In my classroom, I would let students share their feelings regularly so I can understand what they are experiencing and provide support when needed.<br/>
I would also give students team tasks 👥 to encourage collaboration and help them improve their ability to work with others. Group projects and peer feedback would be included to give students opportunities to reflect, communicate, and learn from each other.<br/>
Through these activities, I hope my students will develop not only academic knowledge 💻 but also emotional awareness, empathy, and teamwork skills. My goal is to create a classroom environment where students feel safe, supported, and confident to express themselves, explore ideas 💡, and grow both personally and socially.
</p>
    </section>

    <section id="inclusive">
      <h2>♿ 8. Inclusive Education & ZPD</h2>
      <p>I believe that inclusive education is very important because every student, no matter their ability or background, should have a chance to learn and succeed. In my classroom, I want all students to feel supported, respected, and encouraged 🎯 to do their best.<br/>
        I would use Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) to help students learn. This means giving help for tasks they cannot do alone but can do with guidance 🧭. For example, I would first show how to do something, then guide students step by step 🛠️, and finally let them try it on their own. I would also use group projects and peer support 👥 so students can learn from each other and feel confident.<br/>
        With these methods, I hope my students will not only learn their lessons but also gain confidence, feel included, and enjoy learning. I want every student to feel that their strengths are noticed and that they are supported in their learning journey.
